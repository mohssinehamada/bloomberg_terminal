# Browser-Use Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Browser Validation Error
**Error**: `Input should be an instance of Browser [type=is_instance_of]`

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Updated the Agent initialization to work with browser-use v0.2.4+
- Removed manual browser configuration from GeminiBrowserAgent
- Updated Agent creation to use `Agent(task=task, llm=llm)` instead of passing browser manually

## üîß Common Issues and Solutions

### 2. Visual Boxes Appearing But Agent Not Working
**Symptoms**: You see the red boundary boxes around elements but the agent seems stuck

**Solutions**:
1. **Check API Key**: Make sure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid in the `.env` file
2. **Check Logs**: Look at `browser_agent.log` for specific error messages
3. **Reduce Steps**: Try running with fewer max_steps (e.g., `max_steps=3`)
4. **Simplify Task**: Start with a simple task like "Go to google.com and tell me what you see"

### 3. Browser Not Opening
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you're in the correct conda environment: `conda activate browser-use-env`
2. Check if Chromium is installed: `playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell`
3. Try running the test script: `python test_simple_agent.py`

### 4. Slow Performance
**Solutions**:
1. The visual boxes (boundary boxes) can slow down performance
2. For faster execution, you can modify the browser config to disable them
3. Use the stealth config for sites that detect automation

### 5. Site Blocking/CAPTCHA
**Solutions**:
1. Use the stealth browser configuration
2. Add random delays between actions
3. Use different user agents
4. Some sites like Zillow have anti-bot measures - the script includes fallback methods

## üß™ Testing Commands

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate browser-use-env

# Test basic functionality
python test_simple_agent.py

# Run main script
python browseruse_gemini.py

# Check logs
tail -f browser_agent.log
```
